            <h2>Our Certificate & Placements</h2>
            <p>Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology (MSIT) was established by Surajmal Memorial
                Education Society in 2001 with the approval of AICTE and affiliation of Guru Gobind Singh
                Indraprasha University. MSIT is ideally located in the Institutional area of Janakpuri, New Delhi.
                The institute has a spacious seven storied building with built up area of 9660 sq.m with a campus
                spread over eight acres of land along with beautiful eco-friendly surroundings. The institute has,
                over a short span of time, acquired and developed impressive infrastructure, expertise and
                resources for imparting high quality engineering education. It is an ISO 9001:2008 certified
                institute and is bestowed with “Diamond Eye Award” for Quality & excellence in Education
                which speaks for its global recognition. It also bags TQM & TQCS Accreditation by OMAC,
                Paris.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Inspired by the life and ideas of Maharaja Surajmal, a great Indian patriot and enlightened ruler
                    of Bharatpur during the eighteenth century, Surajmal Memorial Education Society (SMES),
                    under the chairmanship of Shri Birjender Singh (Maharaja of Bharatpur), started its journey in
                    1972 and was registered under Societies Registration Act 1860 with the aim to disseminate
                    quality education in the technical and professional areas, especially to the students from rural and
                    hitherto educationally deprived regions of our country. SMES has been successfully running
                    various premier schools and technical and professional institutions like Maharaja Surajmal
                    Institute, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology</p>
                    <br>
                <p>The institute has a well qualified, dedicated and experienced faculty. The most contemporary
                    teaching methodologies at MSIT provide ample opportunities for students to develop into all
                    round professionals by keeping abreast of the ever changing technologies. The Institute aims to
                    achieve and excel the high standards set by premiere technical institutions of the country. The
                    traditional classroom teaching is supplemented by regular tests, tutorials, group discussions,
                    extensive lab work, projects, seminars and industrial exposure by way of industry visits and
                    summer training. While teaching engineering fundamentals and keeping pace with the evolving
                    definitions and concepts, a sincere effort is also made to cover the latest innovations in each
                    subject area. The classroom atmosphere is synergetic with interactive and participative sessions.
                    This makes learning proactive and instills in the students a sense of team spirit, responsibility
                    and professional integrity. It helps in building a healthy student-faculty bond, which develops
                    students to their fullest potential and harnesses the best in the teachers.</p>
